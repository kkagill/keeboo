Collaborated with a group of five members to make a product for an industry sponsored project from Moovee Innovations Inc. Developed a geospatial based UX/UI on social drive with location triggered point-of-interest, a car health, driver behavioural dashboard, and GPS navigational vectors. Technologies involved HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Node.js, and Express. The project was managed with a scrum methodology and the use of git in Ubuntu environment.

- Led a team to accomplish our task in a timely manner. Developed a mock-up site and implemented a map section where I imported google map api that shows point-of-interests selected by the user. Also added more features in Stats part, where I calculated total distance traveled, average fuel rate, average distance traveled, etc. 

Got permission from the company to upload front-end side that I did.
